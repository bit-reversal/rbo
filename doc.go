/*
Implementation of the fundamental functions of the 
Bit-reversal Broadcast Scheduling Algorithm RBO 
(see:  https://sites.google.com/site/rboprotocol/ ).
The most important here is the implementation 
of the efficient  NSI (Next Slot In) Algorithm 
that computes the next time slot in the broadcast cycle,
when the receiver has to wake up and listen.
